# AEJMicro: Predicting Cooperation with Learning Models

This is a (very) partial documentation of the AEA's work on reproducing 
the computations in this analysis. The actual analysis was not fully
reproduced due to lack of time, and the authors have integrated 
our feedback into their published repository. This PARTIAL codebase illustrates
the steps we undertook to START the process. The process ran until our time
ran out, so it should be considered as partially successful. 

For a complete description of the process, please see https://doi.org/10.3886/E182668V1 for the replication package and https://doi.org/10.1257/mic.20220148
